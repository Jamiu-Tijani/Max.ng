 for the festive season i will like to implore road users not to park their vehicles within 30m of any junction if they violate this the vehicles will be towed away and they will pay for it ,0
 this is not about working against the people but they re working for their selfish interest in my position i expect to hear from the public with information about the errant officer who will be dealt with ,0
 these commercial bus drivers are very unruly sometimes there is the fear factor of what they can do to officers we lost two officers recently while trying to enforce ,0
 the people are really the problem most of us are self centered most passengers will willingly join a bus that is ready to flout traffic rules arresting these buses come from two angles they abuse you or beg you ,0
 i think all the ministries and agencies know their jobs the fact is that since there are so many bad roads you need to prioritize ,0
 we are a part of the government we do have a working relationship with agencies in charge of fixing roads we must know that there will be heavy traffic while roads are being fixed ,0
